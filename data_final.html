      <h1>Context is Key When Looking at How Dangerous Chapel Hill's Roads Are</h1>
      <p>Although roads like 15-501 and Franklin Street May have the most crashes, it may be more about when you're driving than where that determines your safety.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>By Patrick Seelinger</h3>
      <p>When we go through driver&rsquo;s education, we learn a few things about what can make driving a bit more dangerous. Driving at night or in the rain are usually topics an instructor will go over because these are particularly dangerous times to drive. We get a general idea of why as well: there&rsquo;s not a lot of light, the road is slick, or brakes may not work as well in the rain.</p>

      <p>However, data and research suggest that there is a bit more that goes into a crash. After all, crashes can involve multiple cars, a car and a pedestrian, a car and a cyclist, or simply a car by itself. Each one of these situations presents a new layer to the various dangers on the road, which sometimes include the roads themselves.</p>

<p>The 15-501 stretch in Chapel Hill, for example, accounted for 2,784 accidents from 2010-2016. Franklin Street (both East and West) accounted for only 1,779 by comparison. That&rsquo;s still a large number compared to most other streets in the town, but since the two roads are pretty similar in shape, it would be reasonable to expect a similar number of accidents happening on both.</p>

<p>Also, when looking at when these crashes occur, there are some odd results. Most crashes in Chapel Hill did not happen at night hours, 8:00 PM to 4:00AM, from 2010-2016. In fact, most were in the afternoon, or between noon and 5:00 PM. There are, however, a couple of ways to explain this.</p>

<p>Libby Thomas, a researcher at the Highway Safety Research Center, said that traffic volume is a large factor in why a road may be more prone to crashes. This makes sense as more cars on the road means more chances for accidents to occur. According to data from the North Carolina Department of Transportation, 15-501 has a much higher average traffic volume than Franklin Street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a lot of these high-volume roads like 15-501 you&rsquo;ll see a lot of left-turn maneuvers and less protective signs, things that can lead to more accidents,&rdquo; Thomas said. </p>

<p>In addition to that, areas on the outskirts of town centers tended to have more sparse accidents. Thomas said that this was due to the fact that things like sidewalks and medians send a signal to drivers that they should be more careful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re coming into town, you see these things and say, maybe I should start to actually follow the signs, which a lot of people don&rsquo;t usually,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>She also mentioned that Chapel Hill&rsquo;s position as a town centered around a university could be the explanation for the amount of crashes happening in the afternoon. </p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a university-based economy with a lot of hospital shift workers as well. So they tend to leave around 4 or 5, and you get these peak periods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s not to say that driving in the afternoon is the most dangerous time to drive, or the one when you should be the most careful, though. Even though night time may have less crashes as a percentage of the total crashes overall, in Chapel Hill&rsquo;s case about 13 percent over 7 years, these crashes tend to be much more severe. </p>

<p>For crashes involving pedestrians in Chapel Hill from 2007 to 2013, half of those that either killed or gave the pedestrian a disabling injury happened between 6:00 PM and 4:00AM. For crashes with bicyclists, only 7 were killed or delivered a disabling injury over this time period, but 3 were during these hours. This number was consistent with Thomas&rsquo; statewide research.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Generally, this number creeps up around 6 and continues into early morning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s harder to see people at night, but also because there&rsquo;s less traffic so people drive faster. Impact speed is a significant contributor to the severity of a crash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Based on Highway Safety Research Data from 2010 to 2014, Chapel Hill&rsquo;s rates in this category are a little high. Statewide, The hours from 6:00PM to 4:00 AM accounted for 5,932 deaths or disabling injuries to pedestrians. That is about 42 percent of the 13,988 deadly or severely injuring crashes involving pedestrians.</p>

<p>Bike and pedestrian crashes, however, are relatively rare in Chapel Hill. There were only 321 pedestrian crashes from 2007 to 2013 and 166 bicycle crashes in that same time period. 2010 to 2016, another 7-year span, saw 13,212 total crashes, including those with pedestrians and cyclists. Both types of accidents together would account for only about 4 percent of all crashes had the data been taken from the same time periods. Pedestrian and cyclist data was not available for the years 2013 to 2016.</p>

<p>There are many crashes that involve pedestrians that are not fatal or disabling as well. Most accident data categorize crash severity into six categories: Killed, Disabling Injury, Evident Injury, Possible Injury, No Injury, and Unknown Injury. </p>

<p>Statewide, 4:00AM to 6:00AM from 2010 to 2014 had the highest proportion of the most severe types, Killed and Disabling Injury, compared to the other types. From 4:00AM to 5:00AM, 36 percent of injuries were either fatal or disabling. From 5:00AM to 6:00AM, 39.2 percent had these qualities. From 8:00AM to 5:00PM, this proportion drops to under 10 percent consistently, reaching a low of 5.5 percent at 4:00PM.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looking at the severity of crashes gives a different perspective on things,&rdquo; Thomas said. &ldquo;When you look at just the number of crashes, you get a lot of fender benders that might make something look worse than it is. Getting that context can really show you how dangerous a particular road may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chapel Hill has an Open Data Portal which contains the data used in this report that deals with pedestrian and cyclist crashes. It can be found at <a href="https://www.chapelhillopendata.org/page/home1/"> this address</a> and contains much more than just crash reports. </p>

<p>The map on this page displays all the crashes that took place in Chapel Hill (pedestrian, bike, multiple driver, and single driver) from 2010 to 2016. Many of the locations are approximated using the Google Maps Geocoding service, since many of the reports list a street with no number address. The colors represent various times of day when the crashes took place as follows:</p>
